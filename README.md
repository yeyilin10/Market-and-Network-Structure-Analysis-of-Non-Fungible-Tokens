# Market-and-Network-Structure-Analysis-of-Non-Fungible-Tokens


Our NFT (Non-Fungible Token) project explores the market and network structure of NFTs, which are cryptographic digital assets tracked on the blockchain. We analyze the characteristics of the NFT market and examine the topological structure of NFT transaction networks. Our research provides valuable insights into the NFT ecosystem and contributes to the understanding of this emerging field.





**The project consists of the following parts:**

- Data Processing: This section describes the process of collecting and cleaning the data necessary for the analysis. It outlines the sources of data and the techniques used to ensure data quality and reliability.

- Characteristics of the NFT Market: In this part, the project explores the profiles of NFT buyers and provides an overview of the overall market landscape. It examines factors influencing the market movement and investigates the dynamics of NFT sales.

- Graph Analysis of NFT Transactions: This section focuses on analyzing the topological structure of NFT transaction networks. It defines the graph structure of NFT transactions and examines the distribution of node degrees. It also explores the connectivity and clustering properties of NFT transaction graphs.
